# Weighted Tic Tac Toe - AI Player

This project implements an AI player for a variant of Tic Tac Toe game, known as Weighted Tic Tac Toe, using C++. The AI uses a tree data structure to represent the game board and potential moves, and employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the optimal moves.

## Features

- Game tree representation of the Tic Tac Toe board
- Dynamic generation of subtrees for efficient memory usage
- Minimax algorithm for decision making
- Alpha-beta pruning for optimization
- Board score calculation for weighted Tic Tac Toe
